Photos were taken with a modified webcam where the IR filter was removed, therefore the camera would also capture some NIR wavelengths.
I tried applying some color filtering with some available indexes online but I also tweaked them in an attempt to get a better result.
Results are still inconclusive but I've decided to upload this nonetheless.
